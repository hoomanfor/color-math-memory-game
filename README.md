How to play? 
Each one of the 4 color blocks has a random value between 1 and 12.
By clicking on the blocks, you add points to your total.
Your goal is to make your total match the winning total.
If you do this, you win!
However, if your total becomes greater than the winning total, you lose. If you lose, that's ok, the game starts over.
